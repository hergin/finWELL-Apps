## Topics Discussed

-   Our mentor Colin gave us all positive encouragement on the progress made so far. He had helped guide us in making the skeletal structure that will be kept for all future iterations
    
-   Functionality remains very poor but it allows for an easy UI to be created by anyone who can read the code. (This is important because our clients have mentioned getting different people to work on the project that will connect the API to credit card companies)
    

## Things Clarified

-   Next iteration should have a UI
    
-   Next iteration will use more tests for backend logic.
    
-   Practice presentation for clients
