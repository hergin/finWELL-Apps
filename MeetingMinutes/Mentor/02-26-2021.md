## Topics Discussed
- Discussed progress on UI Tests. Mentioned how it is affecting the project outside of the UITest by adding AutomationIds to Finwell_UI
- Talked about the direction of the project. (Finish UI testing, add backend testing, and add more functionality while adding tests along the way. NOT retroactively adding tests.)
- Aside from that, good work!
- Gave lots of encouragement.
## Things Clarified
- Keep working on testing throughout the project, not just the UI.
- Continue to work on functionality for the app.
