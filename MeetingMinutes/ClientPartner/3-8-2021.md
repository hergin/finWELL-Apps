## Topics Discussed
- Clients interacted with the app, via screen share and taking control of the pc. All feedback is in things clarified

## Things Clarified
- Need to make the budget buttons have a response when being pressed
- Need to make the categories buttons on a sliding bar so the buttons won't be squished
- Need to set the bars max height or set the spending limit in each category wider so the numbers don't become partial hidden 
- Need to make savings goal separate from regular categories
- Need to make clear what belongs in each category for the simple budget
- Need to add helpful educational resources
