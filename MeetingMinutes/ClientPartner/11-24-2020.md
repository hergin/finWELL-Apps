## Topics Discussed

-   The clients did not particularly like us having to use POSTman to show the API is functional. (They wanted to see more of a UI)
    
-   It's possible we did not clarify the importance of having a functional API for the future iterations.
    
-   They had no comments on our documentation.
    

## Things Clarified

-   Our clients would like for us to study various competing software to prepare for the next iteration. Software such as Mint, Personal Capital, MX, as well as others. This way we will have a better understanding of what they want in terms of user-experience.
    
-   Have a strong focus on creating a functional UI, and user account creation for the next iteration.
    
-   Add transaction history for next iteration.
