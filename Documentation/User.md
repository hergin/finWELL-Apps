Summary: By following these steps any user should be able to utilize our Web API to create and save a simple budget which will include the spending limits as well as the title for each of its included categories.

1.  In Visual Studio, press the green play button at the top to build and run the project.
    
2.  Once the WebAPI’s homepage is generated by Swagger, select one of the 4 commands and press the GET button next to it.
    
3.  Once in Swagger, copy the section of the url underlined in red , note that the number after localhost may vary.

4.  Once the URL is copied, open Postman and press on the orange New button in the top left hand corner.
    
5.  In the window, enter a name for your request and specify the collection for the test.
    

1.  All requests have to be included in a collection to be saved; if you don’t have any collections, create a new one by pressing the create collection button.
    

Refer to the picture below as an example.

6.  Press save.
    
7.  Now, paste the URL from Swagger into the “Enter request URL” box in Postman.
    

1.  From the options under the URL box, select Body -> Raw
    

9.  Find the API call you wish to invoke and then add it’s suffix to the end of the url you copied in step 3

Your input to the call will be different depending on the API call that you choose. To get an example of the input that you should have with your API call, click on the call and look at the parameters and example value to determine what the input is. For example, for CreateBudgetCategory, the input will be this snippet of code:

Open Postman once again and go back to the request that you created previously. Navigate to Body -> Raw underneath the URL box and insert the needed input to the call here, if any. For example, the input to to the CreateBudgetCategory call would look like this:
