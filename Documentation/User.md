Below is the FinWell Apps login screen. In its current state it sends you to the home screen, but in the next iteration it will be a fully functional login page with the addition of identity and the api. Pressing Login will take you to the main menu of the app.

By pressing on the menu icon in the upper left hand corner of the screen, our flyout tab opens. Here you can see the list of all of the different pages in our application. For now, we have the Home Page (where you are currently located), the Budget Category page, and the Transactions Page. Press on the categories page to create budget categories.

Upon entering the Categories page for the first time, it will be blank. When populated, though, this page will display all of your Budget Categories that go into making your budget, and your current amount spent in that category. Press the ADD button to add a budget category to your budget.

In the ADD menu, enter a name for the category you are creating and how the spending limit of the category is. Press SAVE to save the category to your budget.

Back on the Categories screen, you should see your newly created budget category. Add as many more as you desire using the method shown above, and then navigate back to the main menu using the flyout menu.

Back at the home screen you should now see all of the budget categories represented by bar graphs for your budget. The closer you are to exceeding your spending limit, the closer the bar turns to red, warning you when categories are getting close to going over their limit.

When you need to update the amount spent in a certain category or you have a change in your budget, you can navigate back to the Categories page and simply tap on one of the categories you have created. Here, you can either update or delete a category based on your needs.

The app saves your budget data locally to the phone using SQLite, so there is no need to worry about closing down the app or shutting off your phone and coming back to the app: all of your budget categories will still be there when you return!

  
  

Back at your home screen, if you want to add a transaction to any of your categories you need only to press the button at the bottom of your bar graph. This will take you to the add a transaction page where you can input the amount spent on the transaction.

When you hit save, it will automatically add the transaction total to your current amount spent for the spending limit.

  

By pressing the transactions button in the flyout menu you will navigate to the transactions page where you can see all of your transactions listed in chronological order. You can add a new transaction from here as well by pressing on the button in the top right corner.

  

Moreover, you can press on any transaction and update it if need be.
