## Savings

Savings is a special category that will remain throughout the changes to your budget denoted by the green button label. By default it will be set to the recommended 20% of your monthly earnings, however you can always put in more than the amount recommended. Your savings goal, as well as any excess, will be tracked in the Monthly Budget Report.

The app saves your budget data locally to the phone using SQLite, so there is no need to worry about closing down the app or shutting off your phone and coming back to the app: all of your budget categories will still be there when you return!

This screen displays all of the categories in which you overspent and overspent, as well as the percentage and dollar amount that you were over/under. Use this information to readjust your budget for next cycle â€” underspending in a category is typically a good thing, but consider allocating less money to that category in the future to put into another category or your savings.

At the bottom of the Monthly Budget Report is where your savings throughout your use of the app are tracked. It displays the amount you have saved this month along with the amount that you have saved each cycle cumulatively. To see a visual representation of your savings increasing, the line chart will display your complete savings history with Finwell.
