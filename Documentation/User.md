By pressing on the menu icon in the upper left hand corner of the screen, our flyout tab opens. Here you can see the list of all of the different pages in our application. For now, we have the Home Page (where you are currently located), the Category page, and the Transactions Page, and the Budget Page, and the Resources Page (Which currently is not functional).

Enter your expected monthly income into the text field to set the limit for all of your categories.

## Create Simple Budget

Next, you have two options. You can have a simple 50/30/20 budget created for you by pressing Create Simple Budget, or you can create your own categories. For now, press create simple budget and navigate back to the home screen to see your budget.

  
  

## Add Category

For users who want a more specific budget, you may add your own detailed categories. Press on the categories page in the flyout menu to create budget categories for your custom budget. This page will display the current amount spent in each of your categories and their respective spending limits. Press the ADD CATEGORY button to add a budget category to your budget.

In the ADD CATEGORY menu, enter a name for the category you are creating as well as its spending limit. Press SAVE to save the category to your budget.

Back on the Categories screen, you should see your newly created budget category. Using the method shown above add as many as you desire, and then navigate back to the main menu using the flyout menu.

Back at the home screen you should now see all of the budget categories represented by bar graphs for your budget. The closer you are to exceeding your spending limit, the closer the bar turns to red, warning you when categories are getting close to going over their limit.

## Edit or Remove Category

When you need to update the amount spent in a certain category or you have a change in your budget, you can navigate back to the Categories page and simply tap on one of the categories you have created. Here, you can either update or delete a category based on your needs.

The app saves your budget data locally to the phone using SQLite, so there is no need to worry about closing down the app or shutting off your phone and coming back to the app: all of your budget categories will still be there when you return!

  
  
  

## Start Budget

When you are satisfied with all of your budget categories, navigate back to the Budget Page to begin your budget cycle. Press start budget and the thirty day clock will begin.

## Add Transactions

By pressing the transactions button in the flyout menu you will navigate to the transactions page where you can see all of your transactions listed in chronological order. You can add a new transaction from here as well by pressing on the button in the top right corner.
