# Business Requirements
## BR1 - Encourage and improve financial literacy as well as awareness of one's own finances in our clients and users.
- Making and maintaining a budget encapsulates the principles of financial literacy. By using our app the user will learn how to manage their money better, which is a form of increased fiscal responsibility. This outcome is useful in and of itself and can also be leveraged by Moneytree in its dealings with corporate networks and financial institutions such as banks.
## BR2 - Exposure for MoneyTree to prospective corporate clients.
- Moneytree is shifting/adding the focus of its services to engage in partnerships with entities such as corporate networks and financial institutions (i.e. banks). To that end, it is important to showcase Moneytree’s potential value as a provider of financial services to such entities.
## BR3 - Encourage partnerships with corporations through tax benefits and employee engagement.
- As stated in BR2, MoneyTree intends to craft partnerships with various corporate networks and financial institutions. One way to achieve this is by providing the employees of these companies with improved financial literacy, as detailed in BR1. Additionally, tax benefits for increased participation in prospective partner’s 401k programs, as well as increasing employee satisfaction, are examples of other potential stemming from this project.
